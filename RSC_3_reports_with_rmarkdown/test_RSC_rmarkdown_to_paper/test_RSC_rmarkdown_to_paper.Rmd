# Introduction

Here are some data:

```{r}
data_raw <- data.frame(
  DV = c(rnorm(50,25,10), rnorm(50,75,10)),
  IV = c(rep("Other",50), rep("UseR",50))
  )
```

# Results

Here is some linear regression with their analysis:

```{r}
res_lm <- lm(DV ~ IV, data = data_raw)

summary(res_lm)
```

and some plots:

```{r}
plot(data_raw$IV, data_raw$DV)
```
