# Version Control

Version control is the process to structure the successive evolution of a content (document, code, ...) and enable collaborative principle in order to avoid mistakes and/or unwanted changes.

Version control is the most basic and the most important data science pipeline.

# Requirements

Software Installation
* Base R https://cran.r-project.org/
* RStudio https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
* Git https://git-scm.com/downloads

--

Platform Account
* GitHub https://github.com/
* Overleaf https://www.overleaf.com/

---

# What are these things?

Base R is the coding language to create you paper/project

RStudio is the working environement

Git is a local folder where all the versions of your paper/project are saved

GitHub is the webserver where all the versions of your paper/project are saved

Overleaf is a collaborative LaTex processing environment

---

# Introduce yourself to Git

```{sh}
# Change name and email associated with your GitHub account
git config --global user.name 'Jane Doe'
git config --global user.email 'jane@example.com'
git config --global --list
```

```{r}
# The usethis package offers an alternative approach. 
# You can set your Git user name and email from within R

## install if needed (do this exactly once):
## install.packages("usethis")

library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Jane Doe", user.email = "jane@example.org")
```

---

# The Workflow

* 1_ Save/overwrite your project/files as normal 
* 2_ Save your project/files on your local Git Repository (commit)
* 3_ Send your project/files to your remote GitHub Repository (push)

--

If you are working with overflow on LaTex
* 4_ Get your project/files in your Overleaf account (pull)
* 5_ Send your project/files to your remote GitHub Repository (push)

---

# Step 1. Create a new repository on GitHub

* Go to GitHub.com and login.

--

* Click the green “New" Repository button
  * Repository name: myrepo
  * Public/Private
  * Check Initialize this repository with a README
  
--

* Click the green “Create repository” button

--

* Copy the URL of your new repository
  * e.g., https://github.com/damien-dupre/myrepo
  
---

# Step 2. Clone the new GitHub repository to your computer via RStudio

In RStudio, start a new Project:
* *File* > *New Project* > *Version Control* > *Git*

--

* In the “repository URL” paste the URL of your new GitHub repository

--

* Decide where to store the local directory for the Project (have a central location)

--

* Click “Create Project” to create a new sub-directory, which will be all of these things:
 * a directory on your computer
 * a Git repository, linked to a remote GitHub repository 
 * an RStudio Project
 
--

If you do not see an option to get the Project from Version Control:
* RStudio can only act as a GUI front-end for Git if Git has been successfully installed AND RStudio can find it.
* https://cfss.uchicago.edu/git05.html#make_sure_rstudio_can_find_git

---

# Structure of R project

Sub-folder organisation
* /data folder for your raw data (use .gitignore to not include them in GitHub )
* /script folder for your side R scripts and functions
* /ouput folder for images and documents

--

Best practices for project organization

--

* Treat data as read only

--

* Treat generated output as disposable

---

# Use R markdown

---

# Step 3. Clone the new GitHub repository to Overleaf

In Overleaf, start a new Project
* *New Project* > *Import from GitHub* 
* Select your GitHub Repository and Click Import to Overleaf

# Everything is connected!

---

# Make local changes, save, commit

Do this every time you finish a valuable chunk of work, probably many times a day.

* From RStudio, modify the README.md file by adding the line “This is a line from RStudio”
* Save your changes and Commit these changes to your local repo
  * Click the “Git” tab in the upper right pane
  * Check the “Staged” box for any files whose existence or modifications you want to commit
  * Type a message in “Commit message”. This should describe for a human what modifications you’ve made to the staged files
  * Click “Commit”

---

# Push your local changes online to GitHub

Do this a few times a day, but possibly less often than you commit.

You have new work in your local Git repository, but the changes are not online yet.

Click the green “Push” button to send your local changes to GitHub. You should see some message along these lines.
